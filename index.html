<h1>About Me</h1>

<p align="justify" >Abhishek Sharma was born in Jaipur, India. He studied Metallurgical Engineering, Material Science, and Microsystems Chemistry at Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi, India and Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum in Germany. He did is PhD in Microsystems Chemistry in Bochum under the supervision of Prof. John S McCaskill. Currently, he is a Research Fellow and Team Lead in Prof. Lee Cronin Group at the Univerisity of Glasgow. 

    His research primarily focuses on exploring complex systems and understanding how information processing occurs in chemical and physical systems. This includes understanding the emergence of living systems from non-living matter, discover novel functional materials, and develop novel computational frameworks. He integrates various disciplines including physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering. The four key topics of my research are Physics of life and matter, Unconventional Computation, Automated Materials discovery using self-driving labs, and Microsystems Chemistry and Microtechnology. Within the Cronin Group, he has co-supervised multiple PhD and MS students in the field of Artificial Life, Chemical Computation, and Digital Chemistry.</p>
